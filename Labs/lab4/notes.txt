Question 1:
The file Numbers.java (in attachment) reads in an array of integers, invokes the selection sort
algorithm to sort them, and then prints the sorted array. Save Sorting.java and Numbers.java to your
directory. Numbers.java won't compile in its current form. Study it to see if you can figure out why.

Numbers.java does not compile because it tries to sort an array of primitive int values with the method

# Sorting.selectionSort(intList);

The selectionSort method is declared as

# public static void selectionSort(Comparable[] list)

which means it only accepts objects that implement the java.lang.Comparable interface.
Primitive types such as int are not objects and therefore cannot be placed in a Comparable[].

To make the program compile you must give the sorting routine an array of objects that do implement Comparable. 
The easiest way is to use the wrapper class Integer (which already implements Comparable<Integer>). 
Declare the array as Integer[] and let Javaâ€™s autoboxing convert each int you read from the scanner into an Integer object. 
Once the array holds Integer objects, Sorting.selectionSort can be called without any further changes.
